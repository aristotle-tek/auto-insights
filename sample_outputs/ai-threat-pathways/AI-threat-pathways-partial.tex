\section{Virus and malware detection methods in cybersecurity}

\subsection{Overview of Malware and Virus Detection Methods}

\subsection{Traditional Malware Collection and Detection Approaches}

\subsection{Obfuscation Techniques in Malware and Countermeasures}

In the ongoing battle between malware creators and anti-malware researchers, obfuscation has emerged as a key strategy used by malware to evade detection (Paper 1). This technique involves the use of packers, polymorphic techniques, and metamorphic techniques to hide the telltale signs of malware, thereby undermining anti-malware software and thwarting malware analysis. The paper highlights the need for new anti-malware approaches that focus on the actions of the malware rather than the methods it employs.

\subsection{Machine Learning and Data Mining Applications in Malware Detection}

Paper 5 presents a static malware detection system that uses data mining techniques such as Information Gain, Principal Component Analysis, and three classifiers: SVM, J48, and Naive Bayes. The system extracts raw features of Windows executables, calculates the calling frequencies of these features to select valuable subset features, and then uses Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction. The system has a detection rate of 99.6\%.

Paper 8 provides a comprehensive survey of Android malware detection approaches based on machine learning. The paper covers a wide range of aspects, including sample acquisition, data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning models, algorithms, and the evaluation of detection effectiveness.

Paper 9 discusses the application of machine learning in various areas of cybersecurity, including malware analysis, threat analysis, and anomaly-based intrusion detection. The paper also discusses adversarial attacks on machine learning algorithms that manipulate training and test data of classifiers.

Paper 13 presents a method for detecting malware based on API log data mining. The method uses hooking techniques to trace the dynamic signatures that malware tries to hide and compares the behavioural differences between malware and benign programs to identify the malware. The method achieves a detection rate of 95\% with only 80 attributes.

\subsection{Deep Learning Approaches for Cybersecurity and Malware Detection}

Paper 6 provides a holistic view of recently proposed deep learning solutions for detecting cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems. The paper presents a six-step deep learning driven methodology for applying deep learning methods to detect cyber attacks against these systems.

Paper 11 proposes an efficient malware detection system based on deep learning. The system uses a reweighted class-balanced loss function in the final classification layer of the DenseNet model to handle imbalanced data issues. The system achieves high accuracy and reduced false-positive rates when compared with conventional malware mitigation techniques.

\subsection{Challenges and Future Directions in Malware Detection Techniques}

Paper 7 provides a comprehensive review of machine learning techniques used in cybersecurity. The paper compares the performance of each classifier based on frequently used datasets and sub-domains of cyber threats. The paper also discusses the current challenges and limitations faced during the application of machine learning techniques in cybersecurity.

\section{Study of invasive species and their impact on ecosystems}

\subsection{Overview of Invasive Species and Their General Impact on Ecosystems}

Invasive alien plants have significant ecological impacts, affecting species, communities, and ecosystems globally (Paper 0). These impacts are not unidirectional and vary in magnitude and direction. Alien plants generally decrease the abundance and diversity of resident species, while enhancing primary production and several ecosystem processes. The impacts of alien N-fixing species are more pronounced on N-cycling variables, but they do not consistently affect other impact types. The impacts are not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems (Paper 0).

A comprehensive assessment of the relationship between invasive species traits and environmental settings of invasion on the characteristics of impacts is needed (Paper 1). The impacts of invasive plants are context-dependent, and the significance of impacts is determined by interactions between species traits and the biome invaded. Invasive plants are more likely to cause significant impacts on resident plant and animal richness on islands rather than mainland (Paper 1).

Exotic species alter the fundamental structure and function of their ecosystems by affecting the biogeochemical pools and fluxes of materials and energy (Paper 4). Invasive species often increase pool sizes, particularly of biomass, and promote accelerated flux rates. The ecosystem dynamics are altered through a variety of interacting, mutually reinforcing mechanistic pathways (Paper 4).

The study of positive species interactions is a rapidly evolving field in ecology. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) suggests that plant interactions change with stress through an outright shift to facilitation (survival) or a reduction in competition (growth and reproduction) (Paper 6).

\subsection{Examination of Invasive Plant Species and Their Ecological Consequences}

\subsection{Analysis of Mammal and Aquatic Invaders: Distribution, Impact, and Management}

The invasion of ecosystems by exotic species is a significant source of biodiversity loss, especially on islands (Paper 2). Mammals, such as rats, cats, goats, rabbits, and pigs, are among the most damaging invasive species on islands. The best response to these effects is to control the alien population, either by regularly reducing their numbers or by eradicating the population as a whole from the island (Paper 2).

Species distribution modelling (SDM) can improve our knowledge and inform marine ecosystem management and conservation (Paper 9). The Bio-ORACLE (ocean rasters for analysis of climate and environment) is a global dataset consisting of 23 geophysical, biotic, and climate rasters that can be used for SDM of shallow-water marine organisms (Paper 9).

\subsection{Invasive Species in Rangelands: Specific Weeds, Their Impacts, and Management Strategies}

Rangeland and pastures, which comprise about 42\% of the total land area of the United States, are susceptible to invasion by introduced dicots (Paper 5). Weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of \$2 billion annually in the United States. They impact the livestock industry, wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources, and reduce plant and animal diversity (Paper 5).

\subsection{Case Study: Impact of Invasive Acacia Saligna in the South African Fynbos}

The invasion of Acacia saligna in the fynbos of South Africa has altered nitrogen (N) cycling regimes (Paper 8). Clearing acacia stands causes changes in soil moisture and temperature, but does not result in differences in IER-available N. The alteration of N availability by acacias increases growth rates of the weedy grass Ehrharta calycina, suggesting that secondary invasions by nitrophilous weedy species may occur after clearing N2-fixing alien species in the fynbos (Paper 8).

\section{Research on immunology and how the body fights off threats}

\subsection{Understanding Pathogen Recognition and Innate Immunity}

The innate immune system is a universal and ancient form of host defense against infection. It relies on a limited number of germline-encoded receptors that have evolved to recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial pathogens, but not by the host. This recognition allows the immune system to distinguish infectious nonself from noninfectious self (Paper 1). 

\subsection{The Role and Mechanism of Pattern-Recognition Receptors in Innate Immunity}

Pathogens express several signature molecules, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are essential for their survival and pathogenicity. These PAMPs are sensed by evolutionarily conserved, germline-encoded host sensors known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Recognition of PAMPs by PRRs rapidly triggers an array of anti-microbial immune responses through the induction of various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons. These responses also initiate the development of pathogen-specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity through B and T lymphocytes (Paper 12).

\subsection{The Impact of Vitamin D-Mediated Human Antimicrobial Response on Toll-Like Receptor Triggering}

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a major role in pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory and immune responses. Activation of TLRs triggers direct antimicrobial activity against intracellular bacteria. In human macrophages, TLR activation up-regulates expression of the vitamin D receptor and the vitamin D-1–hydroxylase genes, leading to induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin and killing of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Paper 3).

\subsection{Differentiation and Function of Regulatory T Cells in Immune Response}

Regulatory T (Treg) cell-mediated suppression serves as a vital mechanism of negative regulation of immune-mediated inflammation and features prominently in autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, allergy, acute and chronic infections, cancer, and metabolic inflammation. The discovery that Foxp3 is the transcription factor that specifies the Treg cell lineage facilitated recent progress in understanding the biology of regulatory T cells (Paper 4).

\subsection{The Functional Perspective of Alternative Activation of Macrophages in Immunity}

Macrophages are innate immune cells with well-established roles in the primary response to pathogens, but also in tissue homeostasis, coordination of the adaptive immune response, inflammation, resolution, and repair. These cells recognize danger signals through receptors capable of inducing specialized activation programs. The classically known macrophage activation is induced by IFN-gamma, which triggers a harsh proinflammatory response that is required to kill intracellular pathogens. Macrophages also undergo alternative activation by IL-4 and IL-13, which trigger a different phenotype that is important for the immune response to parasites (Paper 5).

\subsection{Assessment of Immunological Memory to SARS-CoV-2 and its Duration}

Immune memory against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) helps to determine protection against reinfection, disease risk, and vaccine efficacy. Using 188 human cases across the range of severity of COVID-19, Dan et al. analyzed cross-sectional data describing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells for more than 6 months after infection. The authors found a high degree of heterogeneity in the magnitude of adaptive immune responses that persisted into the immune memory phase to the virus. However, immune memory in three immunological compartments remained measurable in greater than 90\% of subjects for more than 5 months after infection (Paper 6).

\subsection{Inflammatory Signaling in Innate Immune Defenses Triggered by Pathogen Recognition}

The innate immune system constitutes the first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens and relies on a large family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect distinct evolutionarily conserved structures on pathogens, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon PAMP engagement, PRRs trigger intracellular signaling cascades ultimately culminating in the expression of a variety of proinflammatory molecules, which together orchestrate the early host response to infection, and also is a prerequisite for the subsequent activation and shaping of adaptive immunity (Paper 7).

\subsection{The Interplay between Innate and Adaptive Immunity: The Case of Natural Killer Cells}

Natural killer (NK) cells were originally defined as effector lymphocytes of innate immunity endowed with constitutive cytolytic functions. More recently, a more nuanced view of NK cells has emerged. NK cells are now recognized to express a repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors that is calibrated to ensure self-tolerance while allowing efficacy against assaults such as viral infection and tumor development. Moreover, NK cells do not react in an invariant manner but rather adapt to their environment. Finally, recent studies have unveiled that NK cells can also mount a form of antigen-specific immunologic memory. NK cells thus exert sophisticated biological functions that are attributes of both innate and adaptive immunity, blurring the functional borders between these two arms of the immune response (Paper 9).

\subsection{The Expanding Diversity of Effector T Cell Lineages and the Role of IL-17 Family Cytokines}

Since its conception two decades ago, the Th1-Th2 paradigm has provided a framework for understanding T cell biology and the interplay of innate and adaptive immunity. Naive T cells differentiate into effector T cells with enhanced functional potential for orchestrating pathogen clearance largely under the guidance of cytokines produced by cells of the innate immune system that have been activated by recognition of those pathogens. This secondary education of post-thymic T cells provides a mechanism for appropriately matching adaptive immunity to frontline cues of the innate immune system. Owing in part to the rapid identification of novel cytokines of the IL-17 and IL-12 families using database searches, the factors that specify differentiation of a new effector T cell lineage-Th17-have now been identified, providing a new arm of adaptive immunity and presenting a unifying model that can explain many heretofore confusing aspects of immune regulation, immune pathogenesis, and host defense (Paper 13).

\section{Analysis of disaster response strategies and emergency management}

\subsection{Overview of Disaster Response Strategies and Emergency Management}

\subsection{Allocation and Scheduling of Rescue Units in Natural Disaster Management}

\subsection{Understanding Multiplexity in Collaborative Emergency Management Networks}
In Paper 2, the authors explore the multiplex relationships among organizations within the context of emergency management. They examine the role of friendship networks and disaster preparedness networks in predicting sustainable collaborative disaster response networks. The study also investigates the impact of emergency management systems on network building and sustainability. The authors apply inferential network analysis methods to analyze relationships among emergency management networks and examine the predictive power of preestablished network arrangements. The research suggests that friendship networks are important for encouraging organizations to be involved in disaster preparedness networks. However, it is the collaboration ties during disaster preparedness that influence the formation of collaborations during disaster response. The structural attributes of emergency management systems have impacts on the development of multiplex relationships among organizations within various networks. These findings contribute to developing sustainable emergency management networks and provide insights for building collaborative networks in a broader context.

\subsection{Media Influence on Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Response: A Case Study of Hurricane Katrina}
Paper 3 presents an analysis of media agenda setting during and after Hurricane Katrina, with implications for emergency preparedness, disaster response, and disaster policy. The authors conducted a quantitative content analysis of 4 prominent newspapers to examine how the media gathered and distributed news to shape public policy priorities during Hurricane Katrina. The media framed most Hurricane Katrina stories by emphasizing government response and less often addressing individuals' and communities' level of preparedness or responsibility. Hence, more articles covered response and recovery than mitigation and preparation. The newspapers studied focused significantly more on government response than on key public health roles in disaster management. The authors discuss specific implications for public health professionals, policymakers, and mass media so that, in the future, coordination can be enhanced among these entities before, during, and after disasters occur.

\subsection{The Core and Periphery of Emergency Management Networks}
In Paper 4, the authors assess the temporal dynamics of emergency management networks in two moderately sized communities that have served as large-scale disaster evacuation hosting sites in the past decade. The paper uses two strategies for tracking the evolution of these networks across time. First, they develop a network roster using newspaper and newswire data sources across a decade. Second, they develop a view of the evolution of the networks by analyzing emergency operations plans for each community. Analysis of data reveals a contrast between a core set of consistent (mostly governmental) actors and a peripheral set of rapidly turning over (mostly non-governmental) actors. The article concludes with a discussion of the advantage presented by having a two-tier network for evacuation hosting that mixes core and periphery across multiple sectors.

\subsection{Resilience in Emergency and Disaster Management: A Bibliometric Analysis}
Paper 5 provides a snapshot of the intellectual structure of resilience studies. Using bibliometric data collected from 20 emergency and disaster management journals, this article argues that the interdisciplinary nature of resilience research comes from its historical roots. The findings also demonstrate that resilience research in the emergency and disaster management fields is organized into three primary clusters: environmental and ecological issues, emergency and disaster management, and public policy and administration. The article concludes with implications for policymakers, as well as recommendations for future research.

\subsection{Bonding and Bridging Strategy in Hierarchical or Horizontal Collaboration Networks}

\subsection{Inequities in US Federal Response to Hurricane Disasters: A Comparative Analysis of Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico}
Paper 7 aims to evaluate and describe variation in the federal disaster responses to 2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, compared with the need and severity of storm damage through a retrospective analysis. The authors focus on measures of federal spending, federal resources distributed and direct and indirect storm-mortality counts. Their results show that the federal government responded on a larger scale and much more quickly across measures of federal money and staffing to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida, compared with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The variation in the responses was not commensurate with storm severity and need after landfall in the case of Puerto Rico compared with Texas and Florida. The insufficient response received by Puerto Rico raises concern for growth in health disparities and increases in adverse health outcomes.

\subsection{Evolution of Disaster Management: A Case Study of Jamaica}
In Paper 8, the author adopts an analytics of assemblage to analyze the topological transformations in disaster management that sustain its will to truth even as the elements comprising disaster management are reconfigured into assemblages of disaster mitigation. Through a genealogy of Jamaican disaster management, the author shows how participatory and mitigation techniques were deterritorialized from marginalized experiences of disaster and reterritorialized into mitigation policies through the confluence of local disaster events and the global emergence of sustainable development and resilience theory.

\subsection{Tourism Disaster Planning and Management: From Response and Recovery to Reduction and Readiness}
Paper 0 integrates hazards and emergency planning literature with tourism disaster planning research to examine possible deficiencies and future directions for research in this field. The paper argues that an understanding of tourism disaster planning is only possible through an understanding of literature from the hazards, natural disaster and emergency planning field alongside an analysis of previous tourism disaster planning research. This synthesis suggests a ‘post-disciplinary’ approach to researching and better understanding the problem of tourism disaster planning involving researchers from disciplines such as education, communication, sociology, emergency planning, hazards and tourism.

\section{Exploration of threat detection in military defense systems}

(Paper 7) Defending Against Label Flipping Attacks on Malware Detection Systems
Abstract: Malware detection systems are crucial for defending computer networks. However, these systems are vulnerable to label flipping attacks, where an attacker manipulates the labels of training data to mislead the learning algorithm. This paper presents a novel defense mechanism against label flipping attacks. The proposed method uses a combination of multiple classifiers and a consensus function to make the final decision. The consensus function is designed to be robust against label flipping attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using real-world malware datasets. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the robustness of malware detection systems against label flipping attacks.
