\begin{abstract}
Here is the source research question that served as a prompt: ``The inscribed square problem, also known as the square peg problem or the Toeplitz' conjecture, is unsolved: Does every plane simple closed curve contain all four vertices of some square? This is true if the curve is convex or piecewise smooth and in other special cases. Please provide suggestions for diverse approaches from other fields of mathematics that might help solve this problem.''

\section{Topological invariants and algebraic topology}

\subsection{Foundations of Topological Invariants and Algebraic Topology}

In the study of algebraic topology, various papers have contributed to the development of the field. Elmendorf et al. (2007) discusses rings, modules, and algebras in stable homotopy theory, focusing on the category of $\mathbb{L}$-spectra and related topics. This can be mathematically expressed as:

\[
\mathbb{L} = \bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{L}_n
\]

where $\mathbb{L}_n$ represents the $n$-th homotopy group of the $\mathbb{L}$-spectrum.

\subsection{Topological Invariants in Braid Theory and Type II$_1$ Factors}

\cite{Popa2002OnAC} investigates a class of type II$_1$ factors with Betti numbers invariants, proving that a type II$_1$ factor M can have at most one Cartan subalgebra A satisfying a combination of rigidity and compact approximation properties. This can be mathematically expressed as:

\[
\forall M \, (\text{Type II}_1 \, \text{Factors}), \, \exists! A \, (\text{Cartan Subalgebras of } M) : \text{Rigidity}(A) \, \land \, \text{CompactApprox}(A)
\]

In the above equation, \(\exists!\) denotes there exists exactly one, \(\land\) denotes logical AND, \(\text{Rigidity}(A)\) represents the rigidity property of the Cartan subalgebra \(A\), and \(\text{CompactApprox}(A)\) represents the compact approximation property of \(A\).

\cite{Rowley2009SpectralAO} introduces a technique for describing the global behavior of complex nonlinear flows by decomposing the flow into modes determined from spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator associated with the full nonlinear system. The method is illustrated on an example of a jet in crossflow.

\cite{Towne2017SpectralPO} considers the frequency domain form of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), called spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), and establishes relationships between SPOD, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and resolvent analysis.

\section{Graph theory and planar embeddings}

\subsection{Fundamentals of Graph Theory and Planar Embeddings}

Asymptotic enumeration and limit laws of planar graphs \cite{Gimenez2005AsymptoticEA} focus on counting graphs as combinatorial objects, regardless of how many nonequivalent topological embeddings they may have. This makes the counting considerably more difficult.

Rhombic embeddings of planar quad-graphs \cite{Kenyon2004RhombicEO} study embeddings in the plane in which all edges have length 1, meaning every face is a rhombus. The paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such an embedding and describes the set of all such embeddings.

Planar minimally rigid graphs and pseudo-triangulations \cite{Haas2003PlanarMR} prove that planar minimally rigid graphs always admit pointed embeddings, even under certain natural topological and combinatorial constraints. The proofs yield efficient embedding algorithms and provide the first algorithmically effective result on graph embeddings with oriented matroid constraints other than convexity of faces.

\subsection{Applications of Graph Theory in Various Fields}

GraphX: a resilient distributed graph system on Spark \cite{Xin2013GraphXAR} introduces GraphX, which combines the advantages of both data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing graph computation within the Spark data-parallel framework. It leverages new ideas in distributed graph representation to efficiently distribute graphs as tabular data-structures and advances in data-flow systems to exploit in-memory computation and fault-tolerance.

Graph theory approaches to functional network organization in brain disorders: A critique for a brave new small-world \cite{Hallquist2018GraphTA} reviews clinical network neuroscience and identifies four challenges in the field.

GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules \cite{Klicpera2021GemNetUD} closes the gap between theory and practice by showing that GNNs with directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and equivariant to permutation and rotation. The paper proposes the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet) and demonstrates its benefits in multiple ablation studies.

\subsection{Planar Graphs and the Four Color Theorem}

Every Planar Map Is Four Colorable \cite{Appel2019EveryPM} proves the four color theorem by providing an unavoidable set of reducible configurations. The paper uses the method of discharging to produce unavoidable sets of configurations and shows that the initial charge distribution has positive total charge.

\subsection{Graph Drawing and Visualization Techniques}

Handbook on Graph Drawing and Visualization \cite{Tamassia2013HandbookOG} provides an extensive overview of various graph drawing and visualization techniques, including planarity testing, embedding, symmetric graph drawing, proximity drawings, tree drawing algorithms, planar straight-line drawing algorithms, and many more.

Graph drawing beyond planarity: some results and open problems \cite{Liotta2014GraphDB} reviews recent findings and outlines emerging research directions about the theory of ``nearly planar'' graphs, i.e., graphs that have drawings where some crossing configurations are forbidden.

\subsection{Dynamic Graph Algorithms and Planar Embeddings}

Dynamic Graph Algorithms \cite{Eppstein2010DynamicGA} documents the program and outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 22461 ``Dynamic Graph Algorithms", which took place from November 13 to November 18, 2022. The seminar brought together leading researchers in dynamic algorithms and related areas of graph algorithms.

Geographic Routing Without Planarization \cite{Leong2006GeographicRW} presents a new geographic routing algorithm, Greedy Distributed Spanning Tree Routing (GDSTR), that finds shorter routes and generates less maintenance traffic than previous algorithms. GDSTR switches to routing on a spanning tree until it reaches a point where greedy forwarding can again make progress.

Some Results on Greedy Embeddings in Metric Spaces \cite{Moitra2008SomeRO} resolves a conjecture of Papadimitriou and Ratajczak that every 3-connected planar graph admits a greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane. The paper also constructs graphs that can be greedily embedded into the Euclidean plane, but for which no spanning tree admits such an embedding.

\subsection{Challenges and Future Directions in Graph Theory and Planar Embeddings}

Future research in graph theory and planar embeddings should focus on addressing the challenges identified in various fields, such as clinical network neuroscience, graph drawing, and dynamic graph algorithms. Additionally, new research scenarios for visual analytics, network visualization, and human-computer interaction paradigms must be identified, and new combinatorial models must be defined and computationally investigated. Finally, theoretical solutions must be experimentally evaluated and put into practice to advance the field.


\section{Differential geometry and curvature}

\subsection{Foundations of Differential Geometry and Curvature}

In \cite{Catsigeras2013DifferentialGA}, the authors present a short course on the differential geometry of compact manifolds, the exterior Clifford algebra of differential forms, and their applications to classical and relativistic theories of electromagnetism in Physics. The text is divided into four chapters, with each chapter being independent of the others. Chapter 2 focuses on the integration theorems derived from the differential statements of classical Maxwell's equations, while Chapter 3 introduces Lorentz transformations to prove the relativistic theorems of electromagnetism. Finally, in Section 4, Poisson's equation is introduced and solved by global integration.

\subsection{Applications in Finite Element Exterior Calculus and Homological Techniques}

In \cite{Arnold2006FiniteEE}, the authors discuss finite element exterior calculus, an approach to the design and understanding of finite element discretizations for various systems of partial differential equations. This approach utilizes tools from differential geometry, algebraic topology, and homological algebra to develop discretizations that are compatible with the geometric, topological, and algebraic structures underlying the well-posedness of the PDE problem being solved. Applications are made to the finite element discretization of various problems, including the Hodge Laplacian, Maxwell's equations, the equations of elasticity, and elliptic eigenvalue problems, as well as preconditioners.

\cite{Barabanov2020DifferentialGA} presents a large set of binary operations that are algebraically isomorphic to the binary operation of the BeltramiâKlein ball model of hyperbolic geometry, known as the Einstein addition. The authors prove that each of these operations gives rise to a gyrocommutative gyrogroup isomorphic to the Einstein gyrogroup and satisfies several properties of the Einstein addition. They also derive a formula for the Gaussian curvature of spaces with canonical metric tensors and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the Gaussian curvature to be equal to zero.

In (Paper 15), the authors apply differential geometry to dynamical systems, discussing various theorems and techniques such as the Hartman-Grobman Theorem, Liapounoff Stability Theorem, Phase Portraits, Poincare-Bendixson Theorem, Attractors, Strange Attractors, Hamiltonian and Integrable Systems, KAM Theorem, Invariant Sets, Global/Local Invariance, Center Manifold Theorem, Normal Form Theorem, Local Bifurcations of Codimension 1, Hopf Bifurcation, Slow-Fast Dynamical Systems, Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory, Darboux Theory of Integrability, Differential Geometry, Generalized Frenet Moving Frame, Curvatures of Trajectory Curves, Flow Curvature Manifold, Flow Curvature Method, and various models.

\subsection{Semi-Riemannian Geometry and its Role in Differential Geometry}

In \cite{D.2003DifferentialGO}, the authors define orbits for the action of a Lie algebra on a manifold and discuss various notions such as connection, curvature, covariant differentiation, Bianchi identity, parallel transport, basic differential forms, basic cohomology, and characteristic classes for a g-manifold with equidimensional orbits. They also derive a sufficient condition for the projection $M \rightarrow M/g$ to be a bundle associated with a principal bundle.

\subsection{Differential Geometry in Elasticity and Continuum Mechanics}

(Paper 11) provides an extensive overview of differential geometry, covering topics such as smooth manifolds, matrices and Lie groups, vector bundles, algebra of vector bundles, maps and vector bundles, metrics on vector bundles, geodesics, properties of geodesics, principal bundles, covariant derivatives and connections, curvature, flat connections and holonomy, curvature polynomials and characteristic classes, covariant derivatives and metrics, the Riemann curvature tensor, complex manifolds, holomorphic submanifolds, holomorphic sections, and curvature.

\subsection{Interplay between Differential Geometry and Thermodynamics}

In \cite{Quevedo2003DifferentialGA}, the authors present a new approach to the study of thermodynamics in the context of differential geometry. They introduce a fundamental differential 1-form and a metric on a pseudo-Euclidean manifold coordinatized by means of the extensive thermodynamic variables. The connection and curvature of these objects are studied using Cartan structure equations.

(Paper 12) provides an expository review of recent developments in the differential geometry of quantum computation. The authors describe the appropriate Riemannian geometry of the special unitary unimodular group in 2n-dimensions, including the choice of metric, connection, curvature tensor, and optimal geodesics for achieving minimal complexity quantum computations.

\subsection{Differential Geometry in Electromagnetism and Quantum Computing}

In (Paper 13), the authors develop a theory of flow convergence and curvature in plan view for flowlines on ice sheets and glaciers. They show that flow in individual catchments of an ice sheet can converge (despite its overall spreading) because ice divides are loci of strong divergence, and that a sign bifurcation in convergence occurs during ice-sheet 'symmetry breaking' (the transition from near-radial spreading to spreading with substantial azimuthal velocities) and during the formation of ice-stream tributary networks. The theory provides a roadmap for understanding the tower-shaped plot of flow speed versus convergence for the Antarctic Ice Sheet.


\section{Knot theory and braids}

\subsection{Knot Theory Fundamentals and Applications}

\cite{Budden2009KnotsAQ} presents a study on quandles, which were introduced to knot theory in the 1980s as an almost complete algebraic invariant for knots and links. The paper investigates the relationship between a link quandle and the quandles of the individual components of the link, as well as coset quandles, which are motivated by the transitive action of the operator, associated and automorphism group actions on a given quandle. The paper also explores the information loss in going from the fundamental quandle of a link to the fundamental group and applies the techniques to calculations for the figure eight knot and braid index two knots and involving lower triangular matrix groups.

\subsection{Cluster Varieties and Knot Theory}

\subsection{Knot Theory in Nematic Colloids and Chemical Topology}

\subsection{Knots and Braids in Proteins and Molecular Structures}

\cite{Jamrz2014KnotProtAD} introduces KnotProt, a database of proteins with knots and slipknots. The database presents the knotting complexity of the cataloged proteins in the form of a matrix diagram, showing the knot type of the entire polypeptide chain and of each of its subchains. The database also provides extensive information about the biological functions, families, and fold types of proteins with non-trivial knotting.

\subsection{Knot Invariants and Higher Representation Theory}

\cite{Webster2013KnotIA} constructs knot invariants categorifying the quantum knot variants for all representations of quantum groups. The paper shows that these invariants coincide with previous invariants defined by Khovanov for $sl_2$ and $sl_3$ and by Mazorchuk-Stroppel and Sussan for $sl_n$. The technique used is to study 2-representations of 2-quantum groups categorifying tensor products of irreducible representations. The paper also investigates the finer structure of these categories and shows that the categorifications of tensor products are related by functors categorifying the braiding and (co)evaluation maps between representations of quantum groups, which allow the construction of bigraded knot homologies whose graded Euler characteristics are the original polynomial knot invariants.

\subsection{Braid and Knot Theory in Dimension Four}

\cite{Kamada2002BraidAK} generalizes braid theory to dimension four by developing the theory of surface braids and applying it to study surface links. The paper presents the generalized Alexander and Markov theorems in dimension four and provides a complete proof of the generalized Markov theorem. Surface links are also studied via the motion picture method, and some important techniques of this method are studied. For surface braids, various methods to describe them are introduced and developed: the motion picture method, the chart description, the braid monodromy, and the braid system. These tools are fundamental to understanding and computing invariants of surface braids and surface links. A table of knotted surfaces is included with a computation of Alexander polynomials. The braid techniques are extended to represent link homotopy classes.


\section{Geometric group theory}

\subsection{Foundations and Geometry of Discrete Groups}

In \cite{Dolgachev2006ReflectionGI}, the authors provide a brief exposition of the theory of discrete reflection groups in spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic geometry, as well as their analogs in complex spaces. They also present a survey of appearances of these groups in various areas of algebraic geometry.

\cite{Allcock2014GeometricGF} investigates the problem of finding generators for the fundamental group $G$ of a space obtained by removing a family of complex hyperplanes from an $n$-dimensional complex vector space, an $n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic space, or the Hermitian symmetric space for $O(2,n)$, and then taking the quotient by a discrete group $P\Gamma$. The authors show that if $P\Gamma$ contains reflections in the hyperplanes nearest the basepoint, and these reflections satisfy a certain property, then $G$ is generated by the analogues of the generators of the classical braid group. They apply this result to obtain generators for $G$ in a particular intricate example in complex hyperbolic space of dimension 13, which is of interest due to a conjectured relationship between this braid-like group and the monster simple group $M$.

\subsection{Symmetry and Topological Methods in Group Theory}

In \cite{Gens2014DeepSN}, the authors introduce deep symmetry networks (symnets), a generalization of convolutional neural networks (convnets) that forms feature maps over arbitrary symmetry groups. Symnets use kernel-based interpolation to tractably tie parameters and pool over symmetry spaces of any dimension, and are trained with backpropagation. Experiments on NORB and MNIST-rot show that symnets over the affine group greatly reduce sample complexity relative to convnets by better capturing the symmetries in the data.

\cite{McMullen2003AbstractRP} discusses abstract regular polytopes, which are highly symmetric combinatorial structures with distinctive geometric, algebraic, or topological properties. The book provides the first comprehensive up-to-date account of the subject and its ramifications, and is of interest to researchers and graduate students in discrete geometry, combinatorics, and group theory.

In \cite{Sullivan2005GeometricTL}, the authors present a collection of notes on geometric topology, covering topics such as algebraic constructions, homotopy theoretical localization, completions in homotopy theory, spherical fibrations, algebraic geometry, and the Galois group in geometric topology.

\subsection{Geometric and Cohomological Approaches in Group Theory}

\cite{Kropholler2017GeometricAC} is a volume that provides state-of-the-art accounts of recent developments in the fields of geometric and cohomological group theory. The research articles and surveys collected here demonstrate connections to diverse areas such as geometric and low-dimensional topology, analysis, homological algebra, and logic. Topics include various constructions of Thompson-like groups, Wise's theory of special cube complexes, groups with exotic homological properties, the Farrell-Jones assembly conjectures, and new applications of Garside structures.

\cite{Bridson2009GeometricAC} offers a tour through a selection of the most important trends in geometric group theory, including limit groups, quasi-isometric rigidity, non-positive curvature in group theory, and L2-methods in geometry, topology, and group theory. Major survey articles exploring recent developments in the field are supported by shorter research papers, which are written in a style that readers approaching the field for the first time will find inviting.

\subsection{Deformation, Rigidity, and Geometric Invariant Theory}

In \cite{algebras2006DeformationAR}, the authors present recent rigidity results for von Neumann algebras (II1 factors) and equivalence relations arising from measure-preserving actions of groups on probability spaces which satisfy a combination of deformation and rigidity properties. This includes strong rigidity results for factors with calculation of their fundamental group and cocycle superrigidity for actions with applications to orbit equivalence ergodic theory.

\cite{Berczi2016GeometricIT} studies geometric invariant theory for graded unipotent groups over the complex numbers and its applications. The authors show that under certain conditions, the $U$-invariants form a finitely generated graded algebra, and the natural morphism from the semistable subset of $X$ to the enveloping quotient is surjective and expresses the enveloping quotient as a geometric quotient of the semistable subset. They also provide a projective variety which is a geometric quotient by $U$ of an invariant open subset of the product of $X$ with the affine line and contains as an open subset a geometric quotient of a $U$-invariant open subset of $X$ by the action of $U$.


\section{Ergodic theory and dynamical systems}

\subsection{Foundations of Ergodic Theory}

In the study of hyperbolic dynamics, the iteration of maps on sets with Lipschitz structures is used to measure distance \cite{Mirzakhani2010IntroductionTE}. Examples of hyperbolic systems include expanding maps on manifolds, Anosov diffeomorphisms, and the shift map. These systems often give rise to iterated function systems of contracting maps, which create complicated fractal limit sets for orbits. An important example from Riemannian geometry is the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of a closed negatively curved manifold. Many of these systems can be coded as subshifts of finite type.

The dynamics of a holomorphic map near a fixed point is a central topic in complex dynamical systems \cite{Guerini2018ErgodicTA}. In the random setting, given a probability measure $\nu$ with compact support on the space of germs of holomorphic maps fixing the origin, the compositions $f_n \circ \cdots \circ f_1$ are studied, where each $f_i$ is chosen independently with probability $\nu$. The stability of the family of random iterates is mostly determined by the linear part of the germs in the support of the measure. A particularly interesting case occurs when all Lyapunov indices vanish, in which case stability implies simultaneous linearizability of all germs in supp($\nu$) \cite{Guerini2018ErgodicTA}.

\subsection{Nonlinear Dynamics in Deep Learning Systems}

Despite the practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains sparse \cite{Saxe2013ExactST}. The analysis of learning dynamics in deep linear neural networks reveals nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. The study also finds that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can remain finite under certain conditions on the training data and initial conditions on the weights.

\subsection{Quantum Chaos and Eigenstate Thermalization}

The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT) \cite{D'Alessio2015FromQC}. The ETH allows for the description of thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. The review also explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics, deriving basic thermodynamic relations and showing that quantum chaos allows for the extension of these relations to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. The relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated, are also discussed.

\subsection{Joinings in Ergodic Theory}

Joinings play a crucial role in ergodic theory, with applications in various areas such as spectral theory, quasifactors, isometric and weakly mixing extensions, and the Furstenberg-Zimmer structure theorem \cite{Glasner2003ErgodicTV}. The study of entropy theory for $\mathbb{Z}$-systems is also presented, including entropy, symbolic representations, constructions, and the relation between measure and topological entropy.

\subsection{Recurrence and Combinatorial Number Theory in Ergodic Systems}

Furstenberg develops the common ground between topological dynamics and ergodic theory by applying the modern theory of dynamical systems to combinatorics and number theory (Paper 7). This approach allows for the exploration of recurrence in ergodic theory and combinatorial number theory, providing a unified framework for these areas.

\cite{Mancuso2015FractalGI} presents an image analysis method based on the box counting algorithm to characterize grapevine leaves. Despite the lack of self-similarity in vine leaves, their complex structure makes them suitable for fractal analysis. The study found significant differences in fractal dimensions among 11 Sangiovese-related genotypes, with some exceptions. The fractal dimension was found to be environment-independent, suggesting its potential use as a morphological parameter in ampelographic research.

\cite{Leleu2010RecursiveSH} introduces a new technique for topological multi-scale analysis by recursively performing clustering to build a hierarchy and analyzing co-scale and intra-scale similarities. This method can extract an Iterated Function System from any dataset and is efficient in extracting self-similarities, providing elegant solutions to the inverse problem of building fractals. The paper discusses theoretical aspects and practical implementations, along with examples of simple fractal analyses.

\cite{Vegh2013HolographyWT} proposes massive gravity as a holographic framework for describing strongly interacting quantum field theories with broken translational symmetry. Bulk gravitons have a Lorentz-breaking mass term as a substitute for spatial inhomogeneities, breaking momentum-conservation in the boundary field theory. The study finds that the optical conductivity in these systems exhibits an emergent scaling law: $|\sigma(\omega)| \approx {A \over \omega^{\alpha}} + B$. This result is consistent with previous studies that introduced an explicit inhomogeneous lattice into the system.

\cite{Basu2019FractalGO} investigates the fractal geometry of Airy$_{2}$ processes coupled via the Airy sheet. The study proves that the scaled energy difference profile is a non-decreasing process that is constant in a random neighborhood of almost every $z \in \mathbb{R}$, with the exceptional set of $z$ having a Hausdorff dimension of one-half. Points of violation correspond to special behavior for scaled maximizing paths, and the result is proven by investigating this behavior using Brownian regularity of profiles and estimates on the rarity of pairs of disjoint scaled maximizing paths that begin and end close to each other.

\cite{Parker2014LevelsOS} provides a systematic examination of the computational expense and accuracy of Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) for predicting non-covalent interaction energies.

The study finds that controlling the value of $\eta$, the exponent of the breakdown probability distribution, can produce growth patterns similar to actual distribution networks. The electrical characteristics of the fractal-generated networks are measured and compared with real distribution networks.

\cite{Shier2015FractalWP} presents an algorithm that fills rectangles and triangles that tile the plane with an infinite sequence of randomly placed and progressively smaller shapes, producing fractal wallpaper patterns. These patterns exhibit a pleasing combination of global symmetry and local randomness. The paper shows several sample patterns.

Keywords include complex analysis, Riemann surfaces and Teichmuller space, functional analysis, deformation quantization, non-commutative geometry, and quantum groups.

\subsection{Rich Points and Doubly-Ruled Surfaces in Algebraic Curves}

In \cite{Guth2015AlgebraicCR}, the authors study the structure of collections of algebraic curves in three dimensions that have many curve-curve incidences. Let $k$ be a field and let ${\cal L}$ be a collection of $n$ space curves in $k^3$, with $n\ll ({\rm char}(k))^2$ or ${\rm char}(k)=0$. The authors show that either (a) there are at most $O(n^{3/2})$ points in $k^3$ hit by at least two curves, or (b) at least $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ curves from ${\cal L}$ must lie on a bounded-degree surface, and many of the curves must form two ``rulings'' of this surface. The paper also develops several new tools, including a generalization of the classical flecnode polynomial of Salmon and new algebraic techniques for dealing with this generalized flecnode polynomial.
